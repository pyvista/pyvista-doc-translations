Creating an Unstructured Grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an irregular, unstructured grid from NumPy arrays.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-20

An unstructured grid can be created directly from NumPy arrays.
This is useful when creating a grid from scratch or copying it from another
format.  See `vtkUnstructuredGrid <https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGrid.html>`_
for available cell types and their descriptions.

    # Each cell begins with the number of points in the cell and then the points
    # composing the cell
