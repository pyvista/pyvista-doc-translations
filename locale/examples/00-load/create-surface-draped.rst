Drape 2D Surface From Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drape a surface (2D array) from a line in 3D space.

This is a common task to create a 2.5D image/sectional mesh of data like GPR
or airborne EM profiles (geophysics applications). This example provides a look
into how to create a 2.5D sectional mesh from typical data in those use cases.

For this example, we have an instrument path on the ground surface (the line)
and a 2D array of the collected image under that line.

Originally posted in `this support issue <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista-support/issues/135>`_.

Suppose you have some GPR data (or anything that produces a line of data with
values at depth). With these data, you'll have a 2D image/array of your data
values and 3D coordinates of where that line/profile is in 3D space (often
where you collected the data on the surface of topography). Attached below are
some example data for this: 1) XYZ coordinates of a GPR path and 2) a 2D array
of data values produced from the GPR.

the data here are wacky (it's difficult to get shareable data of decent
quality), so ignore them but pay attention to the structure. The coordinates we
have are technically shifted up and we have some NaN filler above the surface
- its weird and just ignore it. You'll typically have a more uniform looking
profile in 2D with the coordinates associated to the top of each column in your
2D array.

View the the path of the GPR profile from a top-down perspective.
Since we have the full coordinates (XY and Z), we can create a structured
mesh "draping" down from those coordinates to hold the GPR image data.
