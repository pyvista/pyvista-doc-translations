Extending PyVista
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :class:`pyvista.DataSet`, such as :class:`pyvista.PolyData`, can be extended
by users.  For example, if the user wants to keep track of the location of the
maximum point in the (1, 0, 1) direction on the mesh.

There are two methods by which users can handle subclassing.  One is directly managing
the types objects.  This may require checking types during filter
operations.

The second is automatic managing of types.  Users can control whether user defined
classes are nearly always used for particular types of DataSets.

.. note::
    This is for advanced usage only.  Automatic managing of types
    will not work in all situations, in particular when a builtin dataset is directly
    instantiated.  See examples below.

A user defined subclass of :class:`pyvista.PolyData`, ``FooData`` is defined.
It includes a property to keep track of the point on the mesh that is
furthest along in the (1, 0, 1) direction.

Directly Managing Types
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Now a ``foo_sphere`` object is created of type ``FooData``.
The index of the point and location of the point of interest can be obtained
directly. The sphere has a radius of 0.5, so the maximum extent in the
direction (1, 0, 1) is :math:`0.5\sqrt{0.5}\approx0.354`

    print(f"Maximum point index: {foo_sphere.max_point}")
    print(f"Location of maximum point: {foo_sphere.points[foo_sphere.max_point, :]}")

Using an inplace operation like :func:`pyvista.DataSet.rotate_y` does not
affect the type of the object.

    foo_sphere.rotate_y(90, inplace=True)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-74

However, filter operations can return different ``DataSet`` types including
ones that differ from the original type.  In this case, the
:func:`decimate <pyvista.PolyDataFilters.decimate>` method returns a
:class:`pyvista.PolyData` object.

It is now required to explicitly wrap the object into ``FooData``.

Automatically Managing Types
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default :class:`pyvista.DataSet` type can be set using ``pyvista._wrappers``.
In general, it is best to use this method when it is expected to primarily
use the user defined class.

In this example, all objects that would have been created as
:class:`pyvista.PolyData` would now be created as a ``FooData`` object. Note,
that the key is the underlying vtk object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-101

.. code-block:: default


    pyvista._wrappers['vtkPolyData'] = FooData








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-104

It is no longer necessary to specifically wrap :class:`pyvista.PolyData`
objects to obtain a ``FooData`` object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-111

.. code-block:: default


    foo_sphere = pyvista.Sphere(theta_resolution=100, phi_resolution=100)

Users can still create a native :class:`pyvista.PolyData` object, but
using this method may incur unintended consequences.  In this case,
it is recommended to use the directly managing types method.

.. code-block:: default

    print(f"Type: {type(poly_object)}")

        poly_object.rotate_y(90, inplace=True)
    except TypeError:
        print("This operation fails")

Usage of ``pyvista._wrappers`` may require resetting the default value
to avoid leaking the setting into cases where it is unused.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-153

For instances where a localized usage is preferred, a tear-down method is
recommended.  One example is a ``try...finally`` block.

    try:
        pyvista._wrappers['vtkPolyData'] = FooData
        # some operation that sometimes raises an error
