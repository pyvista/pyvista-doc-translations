Hide Cells with Ghosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify specific cells to hide when plotting.

This is a lightweight alternative to thresholding to quickly hide cells in a
mesh without creating a new mesh.

Notably, the mesh must be cast to an :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid` type
for this to work (use the ``cast_to_unstructured_grid`` filter).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-20

.. code-block:: default

    import pyvista as pv
    from pyvista import examples
    import numpy as np

    vol = examples.load_channels()
    mesh = vol.cast_to_unstructured_grid()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-23

Decide which cells are ghosted with a criteria (feel free to adjust this
or manually create this array to hide specific cells).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-28

.. code-block:: default

    ghosts = np.argwhere(mesh["facies"] < 1.0)

    # This will act on the mesh inplace to mark those cell indices as ghosts
    mesh.remove_cells(ghosts)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-30

Now we can plot the mesh and those cells will be hidden

.. code-block:: default

    mesh.plot(clim=[0,4])
