Plotter Lighting Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`pyvista.Plotter` class comes with three options for the default
lighting system:

  * a light kit consisting of a headlight and four camera lights,
  * an illumination system containing three lights arranged around the camera,
  * no lighting.

With meshes that don't have depth information encoded in their color the
importance of an appropriate lighting setup becomes paramount for accurate
visualization.

Light kit
=========

The default ``lighting='light kit'`` option recreates a lighting setup that
corresponds to a ``vtk.vtkLightKit``. We can check what type of lights this
lighting comprises:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-37

.. code-block:: default

    # sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 3
    import pyvista as pv
    from pyvista import examples

    # default: light kit
    plotter = pv.Plotter()
    light_types = [light.light_type for light in plotter.renderer.lights]

    # Remove from plotters so output is not produced in docs
    pv.plotting._ALL_PLOTTERS.clear()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-39

Add a white terrain to the scene:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-46

.. code-block:: default


    mesh = examples.download_st_helens().warp_by_scalar()
    plotter = pv.Plotter()
    plotter.add_mesh(mesh, color='white')
    plotter.show()

     (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)]

Three-lights illumination
=========================

Switching to three-lights illumination gives a different character to the
figure, in this case showing less contrast when viewing the mountain from
the top, but having more contrast with views closer to the side. This becomes
especially clear when exploring the figures interactively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-59

.. code-block:: default


    plotter = pv.Plotter(lighting='three lights')
    plotter.add_mesh(mesh, color='white')
    plotter.show()

     (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)]



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-61

Again we can check what kind of lights this setting uses:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-71

.. code-block:: default


    plotter = pv.Plotter(lighting='three lights')
    light_types = [light.light_type for light in plotter.renderer.lights]

    # Remove from plotters so output is not produced in docs
    pv.plotting._ALL_PLOTTERS.clear()

    light_types

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    [<LightType.CAMERA_LIGHT: 2>, <LightType.CAMERA_LIGHT: 2>, <LightType.CAMERA_LIGHT: 2>]



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-79

Custom lighting
===============

We can introduce our own lighting from scratch by disabling any
lighting on plotter initialization. Adding a single scene light to a
scene will often result in ominous visuals due to objects having
larger regions in shadow.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-88

.. code-block:: default


    plotter = pv.Plotter(lighting='none', window_size=(1000, 1000))
    plotter.add_mesh(mesh, color='white', smooth_shading=True)
    light = pv.Light()
    light.set_direction_angle(30, -20)
    plotter.add_light(light)
    plotter.show()





.. image:: /examples/04-lights/images/sphx_glr_plotter_builtins_003.png

     (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)]



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-95

Custom lighting with shadows
============================

Here, we ``enable_shadows`` to enhance the effect that the lighting
angle has.  It has a subtle, but realistic effect.  Notice the sharp
shadows due to the mountaintop.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-103

.. code-block:: default


    plotter = pv.Plotter(lighting='none', window_size=(1000, 1000))
    plotter.add_mesh(mesh, color='white', smooth_shading=True)
    light = pv.Light()
    light.set_direction_angle(20, -20)
    plotter.add_light(light)
    plotter.enable_shadows()
    plotter.show()
