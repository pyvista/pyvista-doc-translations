Disabling Mesh Lighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disable mesh lighting.

While plotters have a default set of lights and there are many options
for customizing lighting conditions in general, meshes have the option
to opt out of lighting altogether. Pass ``lighting=False`` to
:func:`pyvista.Plotter.add_mesh` to disable lighting for the given
mesh:

    horse = examples.download_horse().decimate(0.9)
    horse.rotate_z(-120, inplace=True)
    horse.points = (horse.points - horse.center) * 100
    shifted = horse.translate((0, 10, 0), inplace=False)

    plotter = pv.Plotter()
    plotter.add_mesh(horse, color='brown')
    plotter.add_mesh(shifted, color='brown', show_edges=True, lighting=False)
    plotter.show()

Due to the obvious lack of depth detail this mostly makes sense for meshes
with non-trivial colors or textures. If it weren't for the edges being drawn,
the second mesh would be practically impossible to understand even with the
option to interactively explore the surface:

light rendering, see the :ref:`ref_lighting_properties_example` example.
