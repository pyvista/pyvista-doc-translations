Disabling Mesh Lighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While plotters have a default set of lights and there are many options for
customizing lighting conditions in general, meshes have the option to opt out
of lighting altogether. Pass ``lighting=False`` to ``add_mesh`` to disable
lighting for the given mesh:

Due to the obvious lack of depth detail this mostly makes sense for meshes
with non-trivial colors or textures. If it weren't for the edges being drawn,
the second mesh would be practically impossible to understand even with the
option to interactively explore the surface:
