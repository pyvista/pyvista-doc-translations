"VTK is an excellent visualization toolkit, and with Python bindings it "
"should be able to combine the speed of C++ with the rapid prototyping of "
"Python.  However, despite this VTK code programmed in Python generally looks"
" the same as its C++ counterpart.  This module seeks to simplify mesh "
"creation and plotting without losing functionality."

"While not everything can be simplified without losing functionality, many of"
" the objects can.  For example, triangular surface meshes in VTK can be "
"subdivided but every other object in VTK cannot.  It then makes sense that a"
