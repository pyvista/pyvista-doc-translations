Read Image Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read and plot image files (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, etc).

PyVista fully supports reading images into their own spatially referenced
data objects (this example) as well as supports texture mapping of images
onto datasets (see :ref:`ref_texture_example`).

Download a JPEG image of a puppy and load it to :class:`pyvista.UniformGrid`.
This could similarly be implemented with any image file by using the
:func:`pyvista.read` function and passing the path to the image file.

    # or...
    # image = pv.read('my_image.jpg')

When plotting images stored in :class:`pyvista.UniformGrid` objects, it is
important to specify using the `rgb` option when plotting to ensure that the
image's true colors are used and not mapped.
