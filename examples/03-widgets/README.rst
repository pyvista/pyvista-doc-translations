Widgets
-------

PyVista has several widgets that can be added to the rendering scene to control
filters like clipping, slicing, and thresholding - specifically there are
widgets to control the positions of boxes, planes, and lines or slider bars
which can all be highly customized through the use of custom callback
functions.

Here we'll take a look at the various widgets, some helper methods that leverage
those widgets to do common tasks, and demonstrate how to leverage the widgets
for user defined tasks and processing routines.
