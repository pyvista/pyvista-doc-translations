using the PyVista framework. Many of our <a class="reference internal" href="../../../examples/README.html#examples"><span class="std std-ref">Examples</span></a> simply

<section id="the-pyvista-dataset">
<h2>The PyVista DataSet<a class="headerlink" href="#the-pyvista-dataset" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To visualize data in VTK or PyVista, two pieces of information are
required: the data’s geometry, which describes where the data is
positioned in space and what its values are, and its topology, which
describes how points in the dataset are connected to one another.</p>
<p>At the top level, we have <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">:vtk:`vtkDataObject`</span></a>, which are just “blobs” of
data without geometry or topology. These contain arrays of
<a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">:vtk:`vtkFieldData`</span></a>. Under this are <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">:vtk:`vtkDataSet`</span></a>, which add geometry and
topology to <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">:vtk:`vtkDataObject`</span></a>. Associated with every point or cell in
the dataset is a specific value. Since these values must be positioned
and connected in space, they are held in the <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">:vtk:`vtkDataArray`</span></a> class,
which are simply memory buffers on the heap. In PyVista, 99% of the
time we interact with <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">:vtk:`vtkDataSet`</span></a> objects rather than with
<a href="#id14"><span class="problematic" id="id15">:vtk:`vtkDataObject`</span></a> objects. PyVista uses the same data types as VTK, but
structures them in a more pythonic manner for ease of use.</p>
<p>If you’d like some background for how VTK structures its data, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://vimeo.com/32232190">Introduction to VTK in Python by Kitware</a>, as well as the numerous code examples
on <a class="reference external" href="https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/">Kitware’s GitHub site</a>. An excellent
introduction to mathematical concepts relevant to 3D modeling in
general implemented in VTK is provided by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS">Discrete Differential
Geometry YouTube Series</a>
by Prof. Keenan Crane at Carnegie Mellon. The concepts taught here
will help improve your understanding of why data sets are structured
the way they are in libraries like VTK.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, all PyVista geometry classes inherit
from the <a class="reference internal" href="../api/core/dataset.html#dataset"><span class="std std-ref">Data Sets</span></a> class. A dataset has geometry, topology,
and attributes describing that geometry in the form of point, cell, or
field arrays.</p>
<p>Geometry in PyVista is represented as points and cells. For example,
consider a single cell within a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code>:</p>
<p>We would need a way to describe the position of each of these points
in space, but we’re limited to expressing the values themselves as
we’ve done above (lists of arrays with indices). VTK (and hence
PyVista) have multiple classes that represent different data
shapes. The most important dataset classes are shown below:</p>
<p>Here, the above datasets are ordered from most (5) to least complex
(1). That is, every dataset can be represented as an
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnstructuredGrid</span></code>, but the
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnstructuredGrid</span></code> class takes the most amount of
memory to store since they must account for every individual point and
cell . On the other hand, since <a href="#id16"><span class="problematic" id="id17">:vtk:`vtkImageData`</span></a>
(<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImageData</span></code>) is uniformly spaced, a few integers and
floats can describe the shape, so it takes the least amount of memory
to store.</p>
<p>This is because in <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code> or
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnstructuredGrid</span></code>, points, and cells must be explicitly
defined. In other data types, such as <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImageData</span></code>,
the cells (and even points) are defined as an emergent property based
on the dimensionality of the grid.</p>
<p>To see this in practice, let’s create the simplest surface represented
as a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code>. First, we need to define our points.</p>
</section>
<section id="points-and-arrays-within-pyvista">
<h2>Points and Arrays Within PyVista<a class="headerlink" href="#points-and-arrays-within-pyvista" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways to create points within PyVista, and this section shows how to efficiently create an array of points by either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Wrapping a VTK array</p></li>
<li><p>Using a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.ndarray</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Or just using a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>PyVista provides pythonic methods for all three approaches so you can
choose whatever is most efficient for you. If you’re comfortable with
the VTK API, you can choose to wrap VTK arrays, but you may find that
using <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.ndarray</span></code> is more convenient and avoids the looping
overhead in Python.</p>
<section id="wrapping-a-vtk-array">
<h3>Wrapping a VTK Array<a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-a-vtk-array" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s define points of a triangle. Using the VTK API, this can be
done with:</p>
<p>PyVista supports creating objects directly from the <a href="#id18"><span class="problematic" id="id19">:vtk:`vtkDataArray`</span></a>
class, but there’s a better, and more pythonic alternative by using
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.ndarray</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-numpy-with-pyvista">
<h3>Using NumPy with PyVista<a class="headerlink" href="#using-numpy-with-pyvista" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can create a <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> points array with:</p>
<p>We use a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.ndarray</span></code> here so that PyVista directly “points”
the underlying C array to VTK. VTK already has APIs to directly read
in the C arrays from NumPy, and since VTK is written in C++,
everything from Python that is transferred over to VTK needs to be in a
format that VTK can process.</p>
<p>Should you wish to use VTK objects within PyVista, you can still do
this. In fact, using <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.wrap()</span></code>, you can even get a numpy-like
representation of the data. For example:</p>
<p>Note that when wrapping the underlying VTK array, we actually perform
a shallow copy of the data. In other words, we pass the pointer from
the underlying C array to the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.ndarray</span></code>, meaning
that the two arrays are now efficiently linked (in NumPy terminology,
the returned array is a view into the underlying VTK data). This means
that we can change the array using numpy array indexing and have it
modified on the “VTK side”.</p>
<p>Or we can change the value from the VTK array and see it reflected in
the numpy wrapped array. Let’s change the value back:</p>
</section>
<section id="using-python-lists-or-tuples">
<h3>Using Python Lists or Tuples<a class="headerlink" href="#using-python-lists-or-tuples" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>PyVista supports the use of Python sequences (that is, a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> or
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>), and you could define your points using a nested list
of lists via:</p>
<p>When used in the context of <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code> to create the
mesh, this list will automatically be wrapped using NumPy and then
passed to VTK. This avoids any looping overhead and while still
allowing you to use native python classes.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s show how we can use these three objects in the context
of a PyVista geometry class. Here, we create a simple point mesh
containing just the three points:</p>
<p>These point meshes all contain three points and are effectively
identical. Let’s show this by accessing the underlying points array
from the mesh, which is represented as a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.pyvista_ndarray</span></code></p>
<p>And show that these are all identical</p>
<p>Finally, let’s plot this (very) simple example using PyVista’s
<code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.plot()</span></code> method. Let’s make this a full example so you
can see the entire process.</p>
<p>We’ll get into PyVista’s data classes and attributes later, but for
now we’ve shown how to create a simple geometry containing just points.
To create a surface, we must specify the connectivity of the geometry,
and to do that we need to specify the cells (or faces) of this surface.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="geometry-and-mesh-connectivity-topology-within-pyvista">
<h2>Geometry and Mesh Connectivity/Topology Within PyVista<a class="headerlink" href="#geometry-and-mesh-connectivity-topology-within-pyvista" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>With our previous example, we defined our “mesh” as three disconnected
points. While this is useful for representing “point clouds,” if we
want to create a surface, we have to describe the connectivity of the
mesh. To do this, let’s define a single cell composed of three points
in the same order as we defined earlier.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Observe how we had to insert a leading <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> to tell VTK that our
face is described by three elements, in this case, three points. In our <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code> VTK
doesn’t assume that faces always contain three points, so we have
to define that. This actually gives us the flexibility to define
as many (or as few as one) points per cell as we wish.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>All cell types follow the same connectivity array format:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Number</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">points,</span> <span class="pre">Point</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">Point</span> <span class="pre">2,</span> <span class="pre">...]</span></code></p>
<p>Except for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">polyhedron</span></code> type, in which we need to define each face of the cell. The
format for this type is the following:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Number</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">elements,</span> <span class="pre">Number</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">faces,</span> <span class="pre">Face1NPoints,</span> <span class="pre">Point1,</span> <span class="pre">Point2,</span> <span class="pre">...,</span> <span class="pre">PointN,</span> <span class="pre">Face2NPoints,</span> <span class="pre">...]</span></code>.</p>
<p>Where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">number</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">elements</span></code> is the total number of elements in the array that describe this cell.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we have all the necessary pieces to assemble an instance of
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code> that contains a single triangle. To do
this, we simply provide the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">points</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cells</span></code> to the
constructor of a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PolyData</span></code>. We can see from the
representation that this geometry contains three points and one cell</p>
<p>Let’s also plot this:</p>
<p>While we’re at it, let’s annotate this plot to describe this mesh.</p>
<p>You can clearly see how the polygon is created based on the
connectivity of the points.</p>
<p>This instance has several attributes to access the underlying data of
the mesh. For example, if you wish to access or modify the points of
the mesh, you can simply access the points attribute with
<code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">points</span></code>.</p>
<p>The connectivity can also be accessed from the <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">faces</span></code>
attribute with:</p>
<p>Or we could simply get the representation of the mesh with:</p>
<p>In this representation we see:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Number of cells <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n_cells</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Number of points <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n_points</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Bounds of the mesh <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bounds</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Number of data arrays <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n_arrays</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is vastly different from the output from VTK. See
<a class="reference internal" href="vtk_to_pyvista.html#vtk-vs-pyvista-object-repr"><span class="std std-ref">Object Representation</span></a> for the comparison between the two
representations.</p>
<p>This mesh contains no data arrays as it consists only of geometry. This
makes it useful for plotting just the geometry of the mesh, but
datasets often contain more than just geometry. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An electrical field computed from a changing magnetic field</p></li>
<li><p>Vector field of blood flow through artery</p></li>
<li><p>Surface stresses from a structural finite element analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Mineral deposits from geophysics</p></li>
<li><p>Weather patterns as a vector field or surface data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While each one of these datasets could be represented as a different
geometry class, they would all contain point, cell, or field data that
explains the value of the data at a certain location within the
geometry.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-arrays">
<h2>Data Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#data-arrays" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSet</span></code> contains
attributes that allow you to access the underlying numeric data. This
numerical data may be associated with the <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">points</span></code>, cells, or not associated with points
or cells and attached to the mesh in general.</p>
<p>To illustrate data arrays within PyVista, let’s first construct a
slightly more complex mesh than our previous example. Here, we create
a simple mesh containing four isometric cells by starting with a
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImageData</span></code> and then casting it to an <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnstructuredGrid</span></code> with
<code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cast_to_unstructured_grid()</span></code>.</p>
<p>Let’s also plot this basic mesh:</p>
<p>Now that we have a simple mesh to work with, we can start assigning it
data. There are two main types of data that can be associated with a
mesh: scalar data and vector data. Scalar data is single or
multi-component data that is non directional and may include values
like temperature, or in the case of multi-component data, RGBA values.
Vector data has magnitude and direction and is represented as
arrays containing three components per data point.</p>
<p>When plotting, we can easily display scalar data, but this data must
be “associated” with either points or cells. For example, we may wish
to assign values to the cells of our example mesh, which we can do by
accessing the <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cell_data</span></code>
attribute of our mesh.</p>
<section id="cell-data">
<span id="pyvista-data-model-cell-data"></span><h3>Cell Data<a class="headerlink" href="#cell-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to add scalar data to a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSet</span></code> is to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator.
Continuing with our example above, let’s assign each cell a single
integer. We can do this using a Python <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> and making it
the same length as the number of cells in the
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnstructuredGrid</span></code>. Or as an even simpler example, using a
<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code> of the appropriate length. Here we create the range, add
it to the <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cell_data</span></code>, and then access
it using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator.</p>
<p>Note how we are returned a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.pyvista_ndarray</span></code>. Since
VTK requires C arrays, PyVista will internally wrap or convert all
inputs to C arrays. We can then plot this with:</p>
<p>Note how we did not have to specify which cell data to plot as the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator automatically sets the active scalars:</p>
<p>We can also add labels to our plot to show which cells are assigned
which scalars. Note how this is in the same order as the scalars we
assigned.</p>
<p>We can continue to assign cell data to our <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSet</span></code> using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator, but if you
do not wish the new array to become the active array, you can add it
using <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_array()</span></code></p>
<p>Now, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ugrid</span></code> contains two arrays, one of which is the “active”
scalars. This set of active scalars will be the one plotted
automatically when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scalars</span></code> is unset in either <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">add_mesh()</span></code> or <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.plot()</span></code>. This makes it
possible to have many cell arrays associated with a dataset and
track which one will plotted as the active cell scalars by default.</p>
<p>The active scalars can also be accessed via
<code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars</span></code>,
and the name of the active scalars array can be accessed or set with
<code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars_name</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="point-data">
<h3>Point Data<a class="headerlink" href="#point-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Data can be associated to points in the same manner as in
<a class="reference internal" href="#pyvista-data-model-cell-data"><span class="std std-ref">Cell Data</span></a>. The <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">point_data</span></code> attribute allows you to associate point
data to the points of a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSet</span></code>. Here, we will associate a simple
list to the points using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator.</p>
<p>Again, these values become the active scalars in our point arrays by
default by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span></code> operator:</p>
<p>Let’s plot the point data. Note how this varies from the cell data
plot; each individual point is assigned a scalar value which is
interpolated across a cell to create a smooth color map between the
lowest value at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Point</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code> to the highest value at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Point</span> <span class="pre">8</span></code>.</p>
<p>As in <a class="reference internal" href="#pyvista-data-model-cell-data"><span class="std std-ref">Cell Data</span></a>, we can assign multiple
arrays to <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">point_data</span></code>
using <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_array()</span></code>.</p>
<p>Again, here there are now two arrays associated to the point data, and
only one is the “active” scalars array. Like as in the cell data, we
can retrieve this with <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars</span></code>, and the name of the
active scalars array can be accessed or set with
<code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars_name</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="dataset-active-scalars">
<h3>Dataset Active Scalars<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-active-scalars" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Continuing from the previous sections, our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ugrid</span></code> dataset now
contains both point and cell data:</p>
<p>There are active scalars in both point and cell data, but only one
type of scalars can be “active” at the dataset level. The reason for
this is that only one scalar type (be it point or cell) can be plotted
at once, and this data can be obtained from <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars_info</span></code>:</p>
<p>Note that the active scalars are by default the point scalars. You
can change this by setting the active scalars with
<code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_active_scalars()</span></code>. Note that if you
want to set the active scalars and both the point and cell data have
an array of the same name, you must specify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">preference</span></code>:</p>
<p>This can also be set when plotting using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">preference</span></code>
parameter in <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">add_mesh()</span></code> or
<code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvista.plot()</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="field-data">
<h3>Field Data<a class="headerlink" href="#field-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Field arrays are different from <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">point_data</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cell_data</span></code> in that they are not associated with
the geometry of the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSet</span></code>.
This means that while it’s not possible to designate the field data as
active scalars or vectors, you can use it to “attach” arrays of any
shape. You can even add string arrays in the field data:</p>
<p>Note that the field data is automatically transferred to VTK C-style
arrays and then represented as a numpy data format.</p>
<p>When listing the current field data, note that the association is “NONE”:</p>
<p>This is because the data is not associated with points or cells, and
cannot be made so because field data is not expected to match the
number of cells or points. As such, it also cannot be plotted.</p>

<h3>Active Normals<a class="headerlink" href="#active-normals" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_normals</span></code> array is a special array that
specifies the local normal direction of meshes. It is used for
creating physically based rendering, rendering smooth shading using
Phong interpolation, warping by scalars, etc. If this array
is not set when plotting with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">smooth_shading=True</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pbr=True</span></code>,
it will be computed.</p>

<h3>Active Texture Coordinates<a class="headerlink" href="#active-texture-coordinates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_texture_coordinates</span></code> array is used for
rendering textures. See <span class="xref std std-ref">texture_example</span> for examples using
this array.</p>

<h3>Active Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#active-vectors" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_vectors</span></code> is an array containing
quantities that have magnitude and direction (specifically, three
components). For example, a vector field containing the wind speed at
various coordinates. This differs from <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_scalars</span></code> as scalars are expected
to be non-directional even if they contain several components (as in
the case of RGB data).</p>
<p>Vectors are treated differently within VTK than scalars when performing
transformations using the <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform()</span></code>
filter. Unlike scalar arrays, vector arrays will be transformed along
with the geometry as these vectors represent quantities with direction.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>VTK permits only one “active” vector. If you have multiple vector
arrays that you wish to transform, set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform_all_input_vectors=True</span></code>
in <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform()</span></code>. Be aware that this
will transform any array with three components, so multi-component
scalar arrays like RGB arrays will have to be discarded after
transformation.</p>
